# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project:** LSPosed Modular Framework
**Author:** \[Your Name]
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Version:** 2.1

---

## 1. Purpose and Background

**1.1 Purpose**
Define and document requirements for a modern, annotation-driven LSPosed module framework that supports hot-reloading, remote updates, and auto-generated settings UI.

**1.2 Background**
Traditional LSPosed module development requires manual descriptor files, lacks dependency management, and needs reboots for testing. This project modernizes the development workflow with annotations, hot-reloading, and automated UI generation, while providing robust dependency management and remote update capabilities.

---

## 2. Objectives and Goals

* Replace YAML descriptors with Java annotations for compile-time validation
* Enable rapid module development with hot-reload capability
* Generate settings UI automatically from JSON schemas
* Provide automated dependency management and conflict detection
* Support remote module updates via CDN with signature verification
* Package resource overlays without separate APKs
* Support Android API levels 21 through 35 (inclusive)
* Provide development tools and IDE integration

---

## 3. Stakeholders

* **Primary:** Mobile app developers, module authors
* **Secondary:** End users, LSPosed Manager maintainers
* **Tertiary:** Security researchers, QA engineers, module marketplace operators
