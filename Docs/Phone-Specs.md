## Development Considerations

1. **arm64-only builds & native hooks**

   * All native libraries and Magisk Zygisk modules must include arm64-v8a binaries (and/or armeabi-v7a *only* if testing 32-bit apps).
   * Don’t forget correct `ABI` folders under `module/lib/` and matching `System.loadLibrary()` names.

2. **OxygenOS OEM tweaks**

   * OnePlus sometimes relocates or patches framework classes—inspect `/system/framework/boot-framework.oat` or framework JARs to verify hook targets.
   * SELinux contexts on OxygenOS may be stricter; test under both `Enforcing` and `Permissive` to catch denial logs.

3. **Magisk & Zygisk versioning**

   * Trinity Engine may impose aggressive thermal throttling; long-running hook tasks in `service.sh` should yield frequently to avoid watchdog kills.
   * Ensure your module’s `minMagisk` in `module.prop` is at or below the version that supports Zygisk on OxygenOS 15.0.

4. **Kali Nethunter chroot presence**

   * Chroot mounts may alter filesystem paths (`/data/adb/modules/…` vs. `/data/nhsystem/modules/…`); detect and adapt your scripts accordingly.
   * Network namespaces in Nethunter can affect scripts that push or pull via `adb`; use explicit `adb shell` or chroot-aware paths.

5. **Memory & Performance headroom**

   * With 16 + 12 GB RAM, you have ample heap, but avoid memory leaks in persistent hooks (`service.sh` daemons) to prevent OOM or slowdown.
   * Battery/power managers may kill idle background scripts—schedule any heavy work at boot (`post-fs-data.sh`) or under user interaction.

6. **Storage & Overlay limits**

   * UFS storage is fast, but overlaying large directories (e.g. entire `/vendor/overlay/`) can slow boot; target only the minimal files you need.
   * Keep a close eye on free space if your module bundles large resources (e.g. pre-built binaries or patches).

7. **Display & UI tweaks (if applicable)**

   * If your module modifies UI resources, test at both 120 Hz and lower refresh rates to ensure overlays don’t flicker or mis-scale.
   * AMOLED always-on drivers on OnePlus sometimes lockscreen‐draw pipelines—avoid hooking core UI classes that could conflict.

8. **Camera & sensor hooks**

   * Hooking camera frameworks should respect the high-resolution pipelines; any dex or native patch must match the vendor’s HAL implementation.
   * Sensor services run in system process—if you hook them, confirm no dropped callbacks or latency spikes.

By tailoring your module’s ABIs, filesystem paths, SELinux handling, and performance profiles to these OnePlus 12 characteristics, you’ll maximize compatibility and stability on your device.
