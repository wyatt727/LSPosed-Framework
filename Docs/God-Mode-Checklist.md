# God-Mode Framework Implementation Checklist

## I. Core Framework Enhancements & UX Foundations

### A. Unified Configuration Hub & Companion App/UI
*   [ ] **Design Phase:**
    *   [ ] Define core UX principles for the Hub (simplicity, power, discoverability).
    *   [ ] Wireframe the "App Control Panel" UI.
    *   [ ] Design the "Patch Wizard" flow for common tasks (e.g., PWA file attach, SSL unpinning).
    *   [ ] Design the "Profile Management" UI (save, load, share, create from current state).
    *   [ ] Design the "Live Feedback & Logs" UI (consolidated, filterable logs; real-time previews concept).
*   [ ] **Development Phase (Companion App / LSPosed Manager Integration):**
    *   [ ] Implement basic structure for the Hub.
    *   [ ] Develop communication channel between Hub and framework modules (e.g., via AIDL service or content provider).
    *   [ ] Implement Patch Wizard for at least two common scenarios.
    *   [ ] Implement Profile Management (local save/load initially).
    *   [ ] Implement consolidated log viewer, pulling from `LoggingHelper` across modules.

### B. Enhanced `settings.json` Capabilities
*   [ ] **Framework-Level (`SettingsHelper` & UI Generator):**
    *   [ ] Add support for `description` field in `SettingsField` model and display it in LSPosed Manager UI.
    *   [ ] Implement logic for conditional field display ("dynamic fields") in UI generator based on `visibleIf: { "key": "otherKey", "value": "someValue" }` in `settings.json`.
    *   [ ] Research and prototype advanced pickers (package, permission, activity) for LSPosed Manager UI. This might require contributions to LSPosed Manager itself or a very rich custom settings activity.
    *   [ ] Add `SettingsHelper.listenForChanges(String key, SettingChangeListener listener)` for modules to react to their own setting changes.

### C. Hot-Reload UX
*   [ ] **Framework-Level (`HotReloadManager`):**
    *   [ ] Ensure all module types (method patch, resource override, intent rule) can be applied/reverted via hot-reload.
    *   [ ] Provide clearer visual feedback in logs/toast when hot-reload succeeds or fails for a specific change.
    *   [ ] Explore "partial hot-reload" for specific functions within a module without reloading the entire module.

### D. Visual Cues & Notifications
*   [ ] **Framework-Level:**
    *   [ ] Implement an optional, configurable toast notification (`[YourFrameworkName] is modifying [AppName]`) on patched app startup.
    *   [ ] Develop a subtle, persistent overlay icon (optional) indicating an app is under active modification.

## II. Module Implementation & Integration

### A. SuperPatcher Module
*   [ ] **Core Logic (`SuperPatcherModule.java`):**
    *   [ ] Implement method hooking (`before`, `after`, `replace`) using `XposedHelpers`.
    *   [ ] Implement field reading/writing.
    *   [ ] Implement object instantiation and method invocation helpers.
    *   [ ] Implement dynamic DEX/class loading into target app's classloader.
    *   [ ] Store active patches reliably and unhook them correctly on hot-reload or module disable.
*   [ ] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [ ] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [ ] Design schema for simplified patch definition (class, method, hook type, basic params/return).
    *   [ ] Design schema for advanced JSON/script-based patch definition.
    *   [ ] Implement UI for managing a list of patches per app.
    *   [ ] Develop at least 3 patch templates (e.g., SSL Unpinning, Debug Flag, Log Method).
*   [ ] **Integration Points:**
    *   [ ] Add checks for `PermissionOverride` if reflection fails due to visibility.
    *   [ ] Expose API for other modules (like `ResourceMaster`) to request specific hooks if needed.

### B. DeepIntegrator Module
*   [ ] **Core Logic (`DeepIntegratorModule.java`):**
    *   [ ] Hook `PackageManagerService` methods related to component resolution (e.g., `getActivityInfo`, `resolveIntent`, `queryIntentActivities`).
    *   [ ] Modify returned `PackageInfo`, `ActivityInfo`, `ServiceInfo`, etc., to mark components as exported.
    *   [ ] Implement runtime `IntentFilter` injection/modification logic.
    *   [ ] Implement mechanisms to bypass signature/permission checks that restrict component interaction (use with caution, clearly document).
*   [ ] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [ ] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [ ] Implement UI to list discoverable components (activities, services, providers, receivers) from target app manifest.
    *   [ ] Add toggles for "Expose Component" and an editor for injecting/modifying `IntentFilter`s.
*   [ ] **Integration Points:**
    *   [ ] Document how `IntentMaster` should be used to route intents to components exposed by `DeepIntegrator`.
    *   [ ] If hardcoded checks prevent exposure, provide guidance on using `SuperPatcher` as a fallback.

### C. PermissionOverride Module
*   [ ] **Core Logic (`PermissionOverrideModule.java`):**
    *   [ ] Hook `ContextImpl.checkSelfPermission` and `Activity.requestPermissions`.
    *   [ ] Hook `PackageManager.checkSignatures`.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to grant/revoke/fake permission status based on configuration.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to bypass signature checks.
*   [ ] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [ ] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [ ] UI for listing all standard Android permissions with Allow/Deny/Default toggles per app.
    *   [ ] UI for advanced toggles (signature bypass, cross-user interaction).
    *   [ ] Implement a log viewer within its settings to show permission requests and override actions.
*   [ ] **Integration Points:**
    *   [ ] Ensure it's loaded with high priority by `FeatureManager`.
    *   [ ] Other modules should query `PermissionOverride` status or rely on its effects.

### D. ResourceMaster Module
*   [ ] **Core Logic (`ResourceMasterModule.java`):**
    *   [ ] Use `SuperPatcher` to hook `Resources.getValue`, `AssetManager.open`, `LayoutInflater.inflate`, etc.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to serve replacement resources/assets from module's own storage or a configured path.
    *   [ ] Handle different resource types (drawables, layouts, strings, raw, assets).
    *   [ ] Support dynamic modification of XML values (e.g., color parsing, string replacement).
*   [ ] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [ ] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [ ] Implement a basic resource browser (listing known resource types/names if possible, or allowing manual entry).
    *   [ ] UI for "Replace with file" (file picker).
    *   [ ] UI for "Modify value" for common types (strings, colors).
*   [ ] **Integration Points:**
    *   [ ] Heavy reliance on `SuperPatcher` for the underlying hook mechanisms.
    *   [ ] Consider `PermissionOverride` if writing cached/modified resources to disk is necessary.

### E. IntentMaster Module
*   [ ] **Core Logic (`IntentMasterModule.java`):**
    *   [ ] Hook `Activity.startActivity`, `Context.sendBroadcast`, `Context.startService`, etc.
    *   [ ] Implement robust `Intent` matching logic (action, data, type, category, component, extras).
    *   [ ] Implement `Intent` modification (rewrite fields, add/remove extras, change component).
    *   [ ] Implement blocking and logging of `Intent`s.
*   [ ] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [ ] Design schema for defining `Intent` matching rules.
    *   [ ] Design schema for defining actions (Modify, Redirect, Block, Log).
    *   [ ] UI for creating and managing a list of rules.
    *   [ ] Implement an `Intent` log viewer in its settings.
    *   [ ] Add a "Test Intent" feature in the UI.
*   [ ] **Integration Points:**
    *   [ ] Key for leveraging components exposed by `DeepIntegrator`.
    *   [ ] Can be used to trigger actions in apps based on events captured by other modules.

## III. Framework Infrastructure & Inter-Module Communication

### A. `FeatureManager` Enhancements
*   [ ] **Dependency Resolution:**
    *   [ ] Ensure `module-info.json` parsing for `dependsOn`, `conflictsWith`, `provides` is robust.
    *   [ ] Implement topological sort for module loading order based on dependencies and explicit priorities.
    *   [ ] Handle conflict resolution (e.g., disable conflicting module or warn user).
*   [ ] **Service Locator (`FeatureManager.registerService`, `getService`):**
    *   [ ] Ensure this is thread-safe and well-documented for modules to publish/consume shared services.

### B. Analytics & Diagnostics (`AnalyticsManager`, `DiagnosticsServer`)
*   [ ] **Per-Module Metrics:**
    *   [ ] Ensure `AnalyticsManager` can tag metrics (hook performance, memory) with the originating module ID.
    *   [ ] `DiagnosticsServer` should display metrics filterable by module.
*   [ ] **Configuration API:**
    *   [ ] Allow modules to register custom diagnostic endpoints or data points with `DiagnosticsServer`.

### C. Logging (`LoggingHelper`)
*   [ ] **Consolidated Logging:**
    *   [ ] Ensure `LoggingHelper` uses distinct tags for each module.
    *   [ ] The "Unified Configuration Hub" should be able to pull and display these logs in a filterable manner.

### D. Documentation & Developer Experience
*   [ ] **Module Development Guide:**
    *   [ ] Update documentation on how to create new modules using the enhanced features.
    *   [ ] Provide clear examples of inter-module communication using `FeatureManager` services.
    *   [ ] Document best practices for writing `settings.json` for optimal UX.
*   [ ] **User Guide:**
    *   [ ] Create documentation for end-users on how to use the Unified Configuration Hub, Patch Wizards, and Profiles.

## IV. Specific Use Case: Chrome PWA File Attachment (End-to-End Test)
*   [ ] **Analysis Phase:**
    *   [ ] Identify exact methods/resources in Chrome PWA handling attachments.
    *   [ ] Determine which permissions are checked.
    *   [ ] Map out the intent flow for file/media picking.
*   [ ] **Implementation Phase (using the new modules):**
    *   [ ] Configure `PermissionOverride` for Chrome's storage access.
    *   [ ] Configure `IntentMaster` to change `image/*` or `video/*` GET_CONTENT intents from Chrome to `*/*`.
    *   [ ] (If necessary) Configure `SuperPatcher` to bypass internal PWA JavaScript/Java validation of returned file URIs.
    *   [ ] (Optional) Configure `ResourceMaster` to change UI text from "Attach Media" to "Attach File".
*   [ ] **Testing & Refinement:**
    *   [ ] Test on target device (OnePlus 12, OxygenOS 15).
    *   [ ] Verify PDF, ZIP, and other non-media files can be attached.
    *   [ ] Document this use case as a "Patch Wizard" candidate or a pre-built "Profile".

## V. Build, Test & Release
*   [ ] **Automated Testing:**
    *   [ ] Add unit tests for new core logic in framework and modules.
    *   [ ] Develop integration tests for inter-module communication (e.g., `DeepIntegrator` exposing, `IntentMaster` redirecting).
*   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/build.yml`):**
    *   [ ] Ensure all new modules are included in the build.
    *   [ ] Add a step to validate all `settings.json` and `module-info.json` files.
*   [ ] **Release Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Update version numbers for framework and all changed modules.
    *   [ ] Generate comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md`.
    *   [ ] Tag release in Git.

This checklist provides a detailed roadmap. Each top-level item can be broken down further into specific coding tasks, UI design iterations, and testing procedures.
