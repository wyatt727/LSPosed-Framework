Okay, let's examine the documents in the `Docs` directory to see which ones might be outdated based on the recent changes and the current state of the codebase.

First, I need to see what documents are in the `Docs` directory.

Ran tool
Now I'll read the content of each of these markdown files to assess their accuracy.

I'll start with `XPOSED_API_USAGE.md`.

Read file: Docs/XPOSED_API_USAGE.md
This document, `XPOSED_API_USAGE.md`, appears to be **out of date**.

Here's why:
*   **API Location:** The document states the central Xposed API is at `framework/libs/xposed-api.aar`. However, our recent work involved refactoring to use the API from the `libxposed-api` directory, specifically `libxposed-api/api/src/main/java/io/github/libxposed/api/`. The build files were also updated to reflect this change, removing direct AAR references.
*   **Helper Script `xposed-api-config.gradle`:** While the helper script might still exist, its described functionality of pointing to `framework/libs/xposed-api.aar` is no longer accurate. The dependency management for the Xposed API has likely changed significantly.
*   **Conversion/Setup Instructions:** The instructions for module developers to set up new modules or convert existing ones are based on the old AAR-centric approach.

Now, let's check `libxposed_api_usage_guide.md`.

Read file: Docs/libxposed_api_usage_guide.md
This document, `libxposed_api_usage_guide.md`, is also **out of date**.

Here's why:
*   **Local AAR per Module:** The guide instructs developers to clone the `libxposed/api` repository, build an AAR, and then copy this AAR (`xposed-api.aar`) into the `libs` directory of *each module*. This contradicts the current setup where we have a central `libxposed-api` directory within the project root, and modules are configured to use this central source.
*   **`build.gradle` Instructions:** The instruction to change `compileOnly "io.github.libxposed:api:${rootProject.ext.xposedApiVersion}"` to `compileOnly files('libs/xposed-api.aar')` is outdated. We've moved away from individual AARs in modules. The build files (like in `IntentMaster`) were updated to use `compileOnly project(':libxposed-api:api')` (or similar, depending on the exact `settings.gradle` configuration) or directly reference the source, not a per-module AAR.
*   **Troubleshooting Section:** The troubleshooting advice is geared towards issues arising from JitPack resolution or incorrect local AAR placement per module, which is no longer the primary way the dependency is handled.

Next, `gradle_dependency_resolution_summary.md`.

Read file: Docs/gradle_dependency_resolution_summary.md
This document, `gradle_dependency_resolution_summary.md`, is largely **out of date** in its primary recommendation, although some of the "Key Gradle Concepts Reinforced" are still valid.

Here's why:
*   **JitPack Recommendation:** The document's main thrust is to use JitPack for resolving the `com.github.libxposed:api` dependency. However, the project has shifted to including the `libxposed-api` source code directly as a local submodule/directory (`libxposed-api`) and building it as part of the main project. This was evident from the directory structure and the changes made to `settings.gradle` and module `build.gradle` files during the refactoring of `IntentMasterModule`. We saw `compileOnly project(':libxposed-api:api')` or similar local project dependencies, not JitPack coordinates.
*   **Specific JitPack Instructions:** Consequently, all detailed instructions on how to add JitPack to `build.gradle` or `settings.gradle` for `libxposed:api` are no longer the current strategy.
*   **Ineffective Approaches:** While the list of ineffective approaches (like relying on `api.lsposed.org` or manually downloading AARs per module) correctly identifies past problems, the *reason* they are problematic now is also because the project has adopted a local source inclusion strategy, making JitPack itself an "ineffective/problematic approach" *for this specific dependency* in the current context.
*   **Focus on Version `0.4.2`:** The document repeatedly mentions version `0.4.2`. While the exact version in the local `libxposed-api` might be different, the focus on a specific older version from JitPack is outdated.

However:
*   **Key Gradle Concepts:** Section 4, "Key Gradle Concepts Reinforced," contains general Gradle information (repository order, dependency scopes, `dependencyResolutionManagement`, etc.) that remains broadly true and useful for understanding Gradle, regardless of how this specific dependency is handled.

Next, `Implementation-Progress.md`.

Read file: Docs/Implementation-Progress.md
This document, `Implementation-Progress.md`, seems to be mostly **up-to-date** regarding the completion status of most modules, including `IntentMasterModule`.

However, a key detail from our recent refactoring makes a part of it slightly inaccurate in terms of *how* things are done:

*   **Xposed API Usage:** The checklist items like "[x] Implement method hooking (`before`, `after`, `replace`) using `XposedHelpers`" (for SuperPatcher, and implicitly for other modules like IntentMaster) or similar references to `XposedHelpers`, `XC_MethodHook`, etc., reflect the *old* API style.
    *   While the *functionality* (hooking methods, etc.) is still implemented, the specific classes and methods from the Xposed API that are used have changed. We saw this directly with `IntentMasterModule` where we replaced `XposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod` and `new XC_MethodHook()` with `xposedInterface.hook(method, HookerClass.class)` and separate `Hooker` implementation classes.
*   **ResourceMaster Module:** The note "[ ] Use `SuperPatcher` to hook `Resources.getValue`..." might still be the plan, but if `SuperPatcher` itself was also refactored to the new Xposed API style (which is likely if it's a core component), the *way* `ResourceMaster` would interact with it or the way `SuperPatcher` performs its hooks would be different from the old API.

So, while the "COMPLETE" status for `IntentMasterModule` is correct in terms of its features being implemented, the underlying API calls mentioned or implied in the descriptions for *all* modules would have changed if they've all been updated to the `io.github.libxposed.api` style.

The "Next Steps" also seem reasonable and reflect ongoing work.

Next, `Blueprint.md`.

Read file: Docs/Blueprint.md
This document, `Blueprint.md`, contains several sections that are **out of date** or at least partially inaccurate based on our recent work.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **I. Project Layout & Build Configuration:**
    *   **Root `build.gradle` (`ext` block):**
        *   `xposedApiVersion = '0.4.2'`: This is outdated. The project now includes the Xposed API source directly via the `libxposed-api` local directory, so a specific version string like this for a remote dependency is no longer the primary mechanism. The version would be dictated by the state of the `libxposed-api` submodule/directory.
    *   **Framework Module (`framework/build.gradle`):**
        *   `compileOnly "io.github.libxposed:api:${rootProject.ext.xposedApiVersion}"`: This is outdated. As seen with `IntentMasterModule` and the general shift, the framework (and modules) would depend on the local `libxposed-api` project (e.g., `compileOnly project(':libxposed-api:api')` or however it's included via `settings.gradle`). The JitPack/Maven coordinate is no longer accurate for the core Xposed API.
    *   **Framework Directory Structure (`framework/src/main/resources/META-INF/xposed/`):**
        *   While `module.prop.tpl` might still be used for generating module properties, the direct use of `features.json` and `log-config.json` in this specific path for *centralized* configuration might have evolved, especially with `SettingsHelper` potentially loading schema from per-module locations (`modules/<ModuleID>/settings.json`). The overall configuration strategy needs verification.

*   **II. Module Metadata & Annotations:**
    *   The general concept of using `@XposedPlugin` and `module-info.json` seems to be in line with what we've seen.
    *   The settings schema example for UI generation is plausible.

*   **III. Core Features:**
    *   **Hot-Reloading Support (`onHotReload` example):**
        *   `mUnhooks.values().forEach(XC_MethodHook.Unhook::unhook);`: This line uses the old Xposed API (`XC_MethodHook.Unhook`). If modules are refactored to the new API (like `IntentMasterModule` was), the unhooking mechanism would change (e.g., iterating through a list of `XposedInterface.MethodUnhooker` instances and calling `unhook()` on them).
    *   **Security Framework, Diagnostics Server, Logging System:** These sections describe functionalities. Their accuracy depends on whether their implementation has been updated to use the new Xposed API style if they involve hooking. The general concepts might still be valid.

*   **IV. Development Workflow:**
    *   The module creation structure seems generally correct.
    *   The hot-reload commands (`./gradlew runDevServer`, `./gradlew watchModules`) are plausible but would need verification against the actual Gradle tasks available.

**In summary:**

The most significant outdated information in `Blueprint.md` relates to:
1.  **Xposed API Dependency:** How the Xposed API is included and versioned (local project vs. remote JitPack/Maven dependency with a version string).
2.  **Xposed API Usage in Examples:** Code snippets showing `XC_MethodHook` or relying on the old API's classes and methods.
3.  Possibly some details of the centralized configuration file locations if module-specific configurations have taken precedence.

Next, `God-Mode-Checklist.md`.

Read file: Docs/God-Mode-Checklist.md
This document, `God-Mode-Checklist.md`, is a planning and feature-tracking document. Its accuracy depends on how closely development has followed this plan and how up-to-date the checkboxes are.

Based on our recent refactoring of `IntentMasterModule` and the general shift in Xposed API usage:

*   **II. Module Implementation & Integration (Sections A-E):**
    *   The descriptions for `SuperPatcherModule`, `DeepIntegratorModule`, `PermissionOverrideModule`, `ResourceMasterModule`, and `IntentMasterModule` all contain the line:
        *   "[ ] Implement method hooking (`before`, `after`, `replace`) using `XposedHelpers`." (for `SuperPatcher`) or imply similar usage of the old Xposed API for hooking (e.g., "Hook `Activity.startActivity`..." for `IntentMaster`).
    *   This is **out of date** if these modules have been or are intended to be updated to the new `io.github.libxposed.api` style, which uses a different API for hooking (e.g., `xposedInterface.hook(...)` and `Hooker` classes).
    *   The checkboxes `[ ]` indicate these are not yet complete according to this checklist. If, for instance, `IntentMasterModule` *is* considered complete in its functionality (as `Implementation-Progress.md` suggested), then this checklist is lagging. But more importantly, the *method* described ("using `XposedHelpers`") is the outdated part.

*   **General Outdatedness:** If the project has broadly moved to the new Xposed API, any part of this checklist that assumes the old API for new or in-progress work is inaccurate in its technical approach. The *goals* of the checklist items might still be valid, but the *how-to* is wrong.

*   **Dependency on `Implementation-Progress.md`:** This checklist seems like a more detailed version of or precursor to `Implementation-Progress.md`. If `Implementation-Progress.md` marks `IntentMasterModule` as "COMPLETE," then section II.E here should reflect that (with updated checkboxes), but also, the technical description of *how* it hooks needs to be revised to match the new API.

**In summary:**

The `God-Mode-Checklist.md` is likely **out of date** in its technical descriptions of how module hooking should be implemented (still referring to `XposedHelpers`). If some modules listed with `[ ]` are actually complete using the new API, then the checklist's completion status is also outdated. The overall strategic goals might still be relevant.

Next, `progress.md`.

Read file: Docs/progress.md
This document, `progress.md`, appears to be a high-level checklist of tasks, mostly marked as complete (`[x]`). It tracks the initial setup and framework features.

Given our recent refactoring and focus:

*   **Xposed API Version in Root `build.gradle`:**
    *   The item `[x] Declare common version properties: Xposed API version, minSdk, targetSdk, Java compatibility` is marked complete. However, as discussed for `Blueprint.md`, the way the "Xposed API version" is handled has changed. It's no longer a simple version string for a remote dependency but is tied to the locally included `libxposed-api` source. So, while a property might still exist, its meaning and usage have fundamentally shifted.

*   **General Framework Features:** Most items describe foundational framework elements (module discovery, settings UI, hot-reload, logging, etc.). These are likely still relevant in their *intent*. However, if their *implementation* relied on the old Xposed API (e.g., for any internal hooking the framework itself might do, or how hot-reload unhooks/rehooks), then those specific implementation details would be outdated.

*   **"Example Modules":**
    *   The item `[x] Create Example Modules` (with sub-items for basic module, settings UI, resources, dependencies) is marked complete. If these example modules were created using the *old* Xposed API, they would now be **out of date** as templates or guides for new module development, as new modules (like `IntentMasterModule`) are being built/refactored with the new API.

*   **Relevance to Current Operations:**
    *   Much of this document covers one-time setup tasks or initial feature implementations. While it provides historical context, its direct relevance to the *current strategy/workflow* for module development (especially regarding Xposed API interaction) is limited if those examples and underlying mechanisms haven't been updated.
    *   The "Documentation", "Testing & Quality", "Release Preparation", etc., sections are still to-do (`[ ]`), which is expected for ongoing project development.

**In summary:**

`progress.md` is largely a historical record of initial setup. Key aspects related to Xposed API versioning and any example modules or framework components that used the old API are **out of date** in terms of current best practices for the project. The overall feature set described might still be the goal, but the implementation details for some parts would have changed.

Next, `CI-CD-Pipeline`.

Read file: Docs/CI-CD-Pipeline
This document, `CI-CD-Pipeline`, describes the GitHub Actions workflow. Let's see if it aligns with our recent changes:

*   **Java Version:**
    *   The pipeline specifies:
        ```yaml
        - name: Set up JDK
          uses: actions/setup-java@v3
          with:
            java-version: '8'
            distribution: 'temurin'
            cache: gradle
        ```
    *   However, the root `build.gradle` and `framework/build.gradle` (as per `Blueprint.md` and common Android practice for modern AGP versions) specify `javaVersion = JavaVersion.VERSION_17`.
    *   Using JDK 8 in the CI pipeline while the project is set to compile with Java 17 is a mismatch and will likely lead to build failures or runtime issues. This is **out of date**. The CI should use a JDK compatible with Java 17 (e.g., JDK 17 itself).

*   **Gradle Tasks:**
    *   The workflow includes several custom Gradle tasks:
        ```yaml
        - name: Process Annotations
          run: ./gradlew processAnnotations
        - name: Validate Dependencies
          run: ./gradlew checkDependencies
        - name: Generate Settings UI
          run: ./gradlew generateSettingsUI
        - name: Package Overlays
          run: ./gradlew packageOverlays
        ```
    *   The existence and exact functionality of these tasks (`processAnnotations`, `checkDependencies`, `generateSettingsUI`, `packageOverlays`) would need to be verified against the actual Gradle setup. If these tasks are still part of the build logic and are functioning correctly, then this part is accurate. However, if any of these rely on old assumptions (e.g., how module metadata is processed or how settings are structured), they might need updates.
    *   The main `./gradlew build` and `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew assembleRelease` are standard and likely still correct in principle.

*   **Artifact Upload:**
    *   `- name: Upload APK\n uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n with:\n name: lspf-framework-apk\n path: framework/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
    *   This uploads an APK from the `framework` module. This is plausible if the `framework` module is indeed an Android application (producing an APK). If it's an Android library, it would produce an AAR, and the path/output would be different. Given its name "LSPosed Modular Framework," the `framework` project might be the core app that hosts modules.

*   **General Workflow Structure:** The overall structure of checking out code, setting up Java, running Gradle commands, and uploading artifacts is a standard CI practice and remains a valid workflow. The specific details, like the Java version, are the main concern.

**In summary:**

The `CI-CD-Pipeline` document is **out of date** primarily because:
1.  It specifies **JDK 8** for the build environment, while the project targets **Java 17**. This is a critical mismatch.
2.  The relevance and correctness of custom Gradle tasks like `processAnnotations`, `checkDependencies`, `generateSettingsUI`, and `packageOverlays` would need verification against the current build logic.

The general flow of the CI pipeline is sound, but the Java version needs immediate correction for the pipeline to be functional and accurately represent the project's build requirements.

Next, `Phone-Specs.md`.

Read file: Docs/Phone-Specs.md
This document, `Phone-Specs.md`, provides information about the target device (OnePlus 12) and development considerations related to it.

This document is **likely still accurate and relevant** as it describes the hardware and software environment in which the LSPosed modules are being developed and tested.

*   **OS & Root Information:** Details like OxygenOS 15.0 (Android 14-based), Magisk, Zygisk, LSPosed, and Kali Nethunter are specific to the user's setup and are crucial for understanding the development context.
*   **Hardware Specs:** SoC, memory, storage, etc., influence performance considerations.
*   **Development Considerations:** The advice provided (e.g., arm64-only builds, OxygenOS tweaks, Magisk/Zygisk versioning, Nethunter interactions, memory management, SELinux) is generally sound for developing Xposed/LSPosed modules on this specific device. These points are about the environment and general best practices, not tied to a specific version of an API like the Xposed API itself.

The strategies and workflows mentioned here (like inspecting framework JARs, testing SELinux contexts, being mindful of OEM tweaks) are part of the general process of developing and debugging Xposed modules, especially on customized Android versions like OxygenOS.

**No immediate out-of-date information is apparent in this document based on our recent refactoring.** The refactoring was about the Xposed API *within* the modules, not about the target device's characteristics or general module development practices for that device.

Next, `LSPosed-Framework.md`.

Read file: Docs/LSPosed-Framework.md
This document, `LSPosed-Framework.md`, describes the architecture of a custom LSPosed module framework.

Let's assess its accuracy based on our recent work:

*   **3. Annotation-Driven Development (Code Example):**
    *   The example code for `DebugAllModule` shows:
        ```java
        public class DebugAllModule implements IModulePlugin {
          @Override
          public void initZygote(StartupParam param) {
            // Initialize
          }

          @Override
          public void handleLoadPackage(LoadPackageParam param) {
            // Hook logic
          }

          @Override
          public void onHotReload() {
            // Cleanup and reinitialize
          }
        }
        ```
    *   This uses `StartupParam` and `LoadPackageParam` which are from the *old* Xposed API (`de.robv.android.xposed.callbacks.XC_LoadPackage.LoadPackageParam` and `de.robv.android.xposed.callbacks.XC_InitPackageResources.InitPackageResourcesParam` or similar for Zygote init).
    *   If the framework and modules (like `IntentMasterModule`) are being updated to use the `io.github.libxposed.api`, the lifecycle methods and their parameters in `IModulePlugin` would change. For example, `handleLoadPackage` might be replaced or supplemented by methods that receive `io.github.libxposed.api.XposedInterface` and `io.github.libxposed.api.LoadPackageParam` (which has a different structure/methods than the old `LoadPackageParam`).
    *   The `onHotReload()` method, if it involves unhooking, would also need to reflect the new API's unhooking mechanism.
    *   This section is therefore **out of date** as it reflects the old Xposed API structure for module lifecycle methods.

*   **General Architecture:**
    *   The high-level concepts (host framework, feature modules, dynamic discovery, centralized configuration, settings UI generation, hot-reload, remote updates, resource overlays) describe a sophisticated framework. The *goals* of these features are likely still valid.
    *   However, any part of the "Host Framework" or "Shared utilities (logging, reflection helpers, config loaders)" that directly interacts with or assumes the old Xposed API for its core operations (e.g., how it facilitates hooking for modules, or how hot-reload performs unhooking/rehooking) would be outdated if the underlying Xposed API has changed.

*   **Directory Structure, Dependency Management, Settings UI, Hot-Reload Config, Remote Updates, Resource Overlays, Adding New Module:**
    *   These sections describe processes and configurations. Their accuracy depends on whether the framework's implementation details have changed beyond just the core Xposed API calls. For example, if `IModulePlugin` interface changes significantly, the process of "Adding a New Module" (step 3) would be different.
    *   The hot-reload example showing `./gradlew runDevServer` is plausible.

**In summary:**

The `LSPosed-Framework.md` document is **out of date** primarily in its depiction of the Xposed module lifecycle methods (`initZygote`, `handleLoadPackage`) and their parameters, as these are tied to the old Xposed API. If the `IModulePlugin` interface and the framework's core utilities for hooking have been updated to the new `io.github.libxposed.api`, then examples and descriptions relying on the old API are no longer accurate.

The overall architectural goals might remain, but the implementation details related to Xposed interaction need to be updated to reflect the new API.

Next, `Troubleshooting.md`.

Read file: Docs/Troubleshooting.md
This document, `Troubleshooting.md`, is a guide for diagnosing issues.

Let's see how it holds up:

*   **1. Environment & Build Configuration:**
    *   **Issue: JDK/Gradle Incompatibility:**
        *   "Ensure JDK 8 is on PATH (`java -version` should report 1.8.x)." This is **out of date**. As established, the project aims for Java 17 compatibility (`javaVersion = JavaVersion.VERSION_17`). The troubleshooting step should reflect this, advising to check for JDK 17 or a compatible version.
    *   The rest of this section (SDK paths, OnePlus considerations) seems generally fine.

*   **2. Module Descriptor & Resource Generation:**
    *   "Confirm Gradle task scanned all `modules/*/descriptor.yaml`."
    *   "Ensure each `descriptor.yaml` defines a unique `id`."
    *   This refers to `descriptor.yaml` files for module metadata. However, other documents like `LSPosed-Framework.md` and `Blueprint.md` strongly emphasize a shift to *annotation-driven development* (`@XposedPlugin`) and `module-info.json` for dependencies, supposedly replacing YAML descriptors.
    *   If the project has indeed moved away from `descriptor.yaml`, then this section is **out of date**. If `descriptor.yaml` is still used *in conjunction* with annotations or for a specific purpose not yet clear, then it might be partially relevant. Given the emphasis on annotations, this section is suspect.

*   **3. Plugin Discovery & Hook Implementation:**
    *   "Verify correct method signatures against OxygenOS 15.0 AOSP source." - Still good advice.
    *   "Adjust hook parameters in `IModulePlugin` implementations accordingly." - Still good advice.
    *   "Symptom: No `XposedBridge.log` output..." - `XposedBridge.log` is part of the old API. The new API (`io.github.libxposed.api`) uses `XposedInterface.log()`. So, this specific logging method is **out of date**. The general idea of checking logs remains valid.
    *   The considerations about OnePlus potentially renaming/relocating framework classes are still very relevant.

*   **7. Performance & Resource Management:**
    *   "Minimize work in `initZygote` and `handleLoadPackage`..." - These method names are from the old Xposed API. If `IModulePlugin` has changed to reflect the new API, these specific method names are **out of date**. The advice to minimize work in initialization phases is still good.

*   **10. Logging & Diagnostics:**
    *   "Prefix all log messages with module ID: `XposedBridge.log(\"[Framework] initZygote invoked\");`" - As mentioned, `XposedBridge.log` is from the old API. This should be `xposedInterface.log(...)` or a similar method from the new API. This is **out of date**.
    *   The general best practices for logging (unique tags, capturing exceptions) are still good.

*   **General Tone:** The document mentions "OxygenOS 15.0 (Android 14)" which aligns with `Phone-Specs.md`. The general troubleshooting steps for SELinux, Zygisk, Nethunter, packaging, CI/CD, etc., are often independent of the specific Xposed API version and offer good general advice.

**In summary:**

`Troubleshooting.md` has several key pieces of **outdated information**:
1.  **JDK Version:** Still refers to JDK 8 instead of JDK 17.
2.  **Module Descriptors:** Refers to `descriptor.yaml` which might have been superseded by annotations and `module-info.json`.
3.  **Xposed API Specifics:** Mentions old API logging (`XposedBridge.log`) and lifecycle methods (`initZygote`, `handleLoadPackage`) instead of their new API equivalents.

Many other sections provide general troubleshooting advice that is still valuable for the described environment.

Next, `Automations.md`.

Read file: Docs/Automations.md
This document, `Automations.md`, lists various Gradle tasks and automation scripts apparently available in the project.

Its accuracy depends entirely on whether these Gradle tasks actually exist and function as described.

*   **1.1 Annotation Processing:**
    *   `./gradlew processAnnotations`
    *   Generated files: `META-INF/xposed/java_init.list`, `META-INF/xposed/scope.list`, `module.prop`.
    *   This aligns with the idea of annotation-driven development. If this task correctly generates these files based on `@XposedPlugin` and other annotations, and reflects the new Xposed API requirements (e.g., correct class names in `java_init.list`), then it's current.
    *   The `scope.list` generation implies that module scope is also handled via annotations, which is plausible.

*   **Consistency with CI/CD:**
    *   The GitHub Actions workflow in `CI-CD-Pipeline` also calls `./gradlew processAnnotations`, `./gradlew checkDependencies`, `./gradlew generateSettingsUI`, `./gradlew packageOverlays`. The existence of these tasks in `Automations.md` reinforces that they are (or were) intended parts of the build.

*   **New vs. Old API:**
    *   The critical point for many of these automations, especially those related to code generation, validation, or testing (`processAnnotations`, `validateAnnotations`, `testHotReload`), is whether they have been updated to understand and work with the new `io.github.libxposed.api`.
    *   For example, if `processAnnotations` generates an `java_init.list` that points to classes expecting old API parameters, it would be outdated. If `validateAnnotations` checks for adherence to old API patterns, it's outdated. If `testHotReload` assumes the old unhooking mechanisms, it's outdated.

*   **Existence of Tasks:**
    *   This document lists a *large* number of custom Gradle tasks (e.g., `previewSettings`, `generateDependencyGraph`, `validateOverlays`, `monitorHotReload`, `tailLogs`, `profileHooks`, `integrationTest`, `testHotReload`, `generateChangelog`, `signUpdate`, `uploadToCDN`, `notifyClients`, `monitorHooks`, `trackMemory`, `performanceReport`, `collectMetrics`, `generateDashboard`, `exportAnalytics`).
    *   Without verifying the project's `build.gradle` files, it's hard to confirm if all these tasks exist and are functional. Some might be aspirational or from a template.

**In summary:**

`Automations.md` describes a potentially extensive set of build and development automations.
*   Its accuracy hinges on:
    1.  The actual existence and functionality of the listed Gradle tasks.
    2.  Whether these tasks, particularly those involved in code generation, validation, and testing, have been updated to be compatible with the new `io.github.libxposed.api` and the current project structure.
*   If the project relies heavily on these automations, and they haven't been updated for the new API, then the "general process of how this program actually operates" would be significantly impacted, as the automations would be producing incorrect outputs or failing.
*   Tasks related to annotation processing are particularly important to verify, as they directly impact how modules are recognized and loaded by LSPosed.

Finally, `PRD.md`.

Read file: Docs/PRD.md
This document, `PRD.md` (Product Requirements Document), outlines the goals, features, and scope of the LSPosed Modular Framework.

Let's evaluate its current accuracy:

*   **1.2 Background & 2. Objectives and Goals:**
    *   "Traditional LSPosed module development requires manual descriptor files..."
    *   "Replace YAML descriptors with Java annotations for compile-time validation"
    *   These statements align with the move towards annotation-driven development seen in other documents. If this transition is complete or well underway, this part is accurate.

*   **8. Use Cases (Development Workflow example):**
    *   The example code:
        ```java
        public class DevModule implements IModulePlugin {
          @Override
          public void onHotReload() {
            // Live code updates without rebooting
          }
        }
        ```
    *   This snippet is incomplete as it doesn't show the core Xposed lifecycle methods like `handleLoadPackage` or `initZygote`. However, if the `IModulePlugin` interface itself and its methods have changed due to the new `io.github.libxposed.api`, then any examples or expectations based on the old API's method signatures would be implicitly outdated. The PRD should ideally reflect the primary methods a developer would implement.

*   **11. Dependencies:**
    *   **"LSPosed API 0.4.2+"**: This is **out of date**. The project has moved to include the `libxposed-api` source code directly (from `io.github.libxposed.api`), making a specific version number for a remote/general LSPosed API less relevant for *how the framework itself is built and how modules link against the API*. The dependency is now more specific to the version of `io.github.libxposed.api` included in the `libxposed-api` directory.
    *   **"Java 8+"**: This is **out of date**. The project targets Java 17, as seen in `build.gradle` configurations (`JavaVersion.VERSION_17`). The requirement should be Java 17+.

*   **General Requirements & Scope:**
    *   Most functional requirements (FR-01 to FR-10) and non-functional requirements (NFR-01 to NFR-08) describe desired features and characteristics (annotation processing, hot-reload, settings generation, performance, security). These high-level goals are likely still valid.
    *   The accuracy concern comes when these requirements imply or depend on the *old* Xposed API. For example, "Annotation Processing" (FR-01) must now process annotations and generate metadata compatible with the *new* API. "Hot-Reload Server" (FR-02) must be able to unhook and rehook using the *new* API's mechanisms.

**In summary:**

The `PRD.md` is **out of date** in several critical areas:
1.  **Dependencies (Section 11):** Specifies "LSPosed API 0.4.2+" and "Java 8+", both of which are incorrect given the project's shift to a locally included `io.github.libxposed.api` and Java 17.
2.  **Implicit API Assumptions:** While not always explicit, the descriptions of features like annotation processing, hot-reload, and the `IModulePlugin` interface need to be understood in the context of the new `io.github.libxposed.api`. If the PRD was written with the old API in mind, then the *how* of achieving these requirements has changed.

The overall vision and high-level feature set described in the PRD may still align with the project's direction, but the technical underpinnings (especially regarding API versions and Java version) need updating to reflect the current state.

Based on the review of all documents, here's a summary of which ones are out of date and why, focusing on how they no longer accurately represent the strategy, workflow, blueprint, PRD, or general process:

**Significantly Out of Date / Misrepresenting Current Strategy:**

1.  **`XPOSED_API_USAGE.md`**:
    *   **Reason:** Describes a centralized Xposed API as an AAR (`framework/libs/xposed-api.aar`) and a helper script (`xposed-api-config.gradle`) to manage it. This is outdated as the project now uses the `libxposed-api` source directory directly, and module dependencies point to this local project, not a central AAR in the framework. The entire workflow described for API usage is incorrect.

2.  **`libxposed_api_usage_guide.md`**:
    *   **Reason:** Instructs building `libxposed:api` AAR locally and copying it into *each module's* `libs` folder. This directly contradicts the current strategy of using a single, centrally managed `libxposed-api` source directory within the project. The `build.gradle` modification instructions are also outdated.

3.  **`gradle_dependency_resolution_summary.md`**:
    *   **Reason:** Strongly recommends and details using JitPack for the `com.github.libxposed:api` dependency. The project has moved away from JitPack for this core API in favor of including the source directly via the `libxposed-api` directory. Thus, its primary solution is no longer the project's strategy.

4.  **`PRD.md` (Product Requirements Document)**:
    *   **Reason:** Section 11 (Dependencies) lists "LSPosed API 0.4.2+" and "Java 8+", both of which are incorrect. The project uses a locally included `io.github.libxposed.api` (version dictated by that local copy) and targets Java 17. These are fundamental aspects of the project's technical baseline.

5.  **`Troubleshooting.md`**:
    *   **Reason:**
        *   Recommends JDK 8 (should be JDK 17+).
        *   Refers to `descriptor.yaml` for module metadata, which seems to have been replaced by annotations (`@XposedPlugin`) and `module-info.json`.
        *   Mentions old Xposed API logging (`XposedBridge.log`) and lifecycle method names (`initZygote`, `handleLoadPackage`) instead of the new API equivalents. This inaccurately represents how current module code would be written and debugged.

6.  **`CI-CD-Pipeline`**:
    *   **Reason:** Specifies JDK 8 for the GitHub Actions build environment, which clashes with the project's Java 17 target. This would lead to build failures or inconsistencies and does not reflect the actual build requirements.

**Partially Out of Date / Inaccurate Details:**

7.  **`Blueprint.md`**:
    *   **Reason:**
        *   Outdated `xposedApiVersion = '0.4.2'` in root `build.gradle` and `compileOnly "io.github.libxposed:api:${rootProject.ext.xposedApiVersion}"` in framework `build.gradle`. These do not reflect the local `libxposed-api` source dependency.
        *   Code examples for hot-reloading use old Xposed API (`XC_MethodHook.Unhook`). This misrepresents how current code using the new API would operate.

8.  **`LSPosed-Framework.md` (Architecture Document)**:
    *   **Reason:** The example code for `IModulePlugin` shows old Xposed API lifecycle methods and parameters (`initZygote(StartupParam)`, `handleLoadPackage(LoadPackageParam)`). This does not accurately represent how modules are structured if they use the new `io.github.libxposed.api`.

9.  **`God-Mode-Checklist.md` (Implementation Checklist)**:
    *   **Reason:** Module implementation sections (e.g., for `SuperPatcher`, `IntentMaster`) describe hooking "using `XposedHelpers`" or imply use of the old API. This is inaccurate if modules are being built/updated with the new API. The completion status might also be lagging if modules are complete using the new API.

10. **`Implementation-Progress.md`**:
    *   **Reason:** While module completion statuses might be broadly correct, descriptions of *how* core functionalities (like method hooking) are achieved implicitly refer to the old Xposed API (e.g., "using `XposedHelpers`"). This detail of the *workflow/process* is outdated for modules using the new API.

11. **`progress.md` (High-level checklist)**:
    *   **Reason:** The item "Declare common version properties: Xposed API version" is outdated in its implication of how the API version is managed (now tied to local `libxposed-api` source, not a simple remote version string). Example modules created using the old API would also be outdated as current templates.

12. **`Automations.md`**:
    *   **Reason:** The accuracy of many listed Gradle tasks (especially for code generation, validation, testing) is questionable if they haven't been updated to support the new `io.github.libxposed.api`. If these automations are a core part of the workflow and are outdated, the document misrepresents the current operational process. For instance, `processAnnotations` generating metadata for the old API would be a significant issue.

**Likely Still Accurate / Relevant:**

13. **`Phone-Specs.md`**:
    *   **Reason:** Describes the specific hardware/software environment of the user's test device. This information is generally static and relevant for contextual development decisions, regardless of the Xposed API version used in the modules.

**Summary of Outdated Themes:**

*   **Xposed API Handling:** The biggest source of outdated information is the transition from using a generic/older Xposed API (often via AARs, JitPack, or `XposedBridge`/`XposedHelpers`) to the new `io.github.libxposed.api` included as a local source project (`libxposed-api`). Documents describing the old way of depending on, using, or troubleshooting this API are inaccurate.
*   **Java Version:** References to JDK 8 are outdated; the project uses Java 17.
*   **Module Metadata:** Shift from `descriptor.yaml` (if it was used) to annotations (`@XposedPlugin`) and `module-info.json`.
*   **Build/Automation Tasks:** Any Gradle tasks or CI steps that assume the old API or Java version are outdated.

These outdated documents would mislead anyone trying to understand the project's current build process, module development workflow, architectural dependencies, or troubleshooting steps.
