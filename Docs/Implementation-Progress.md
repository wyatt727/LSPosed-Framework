# God-Mode Framework Implementation Progress

## II. Module Implementation & Integration

### A. SuperPatcher Module [COMPLETE]
*   [x] **Core Logic (`SuperPatcherModule.java`):**
    *   [x] Implement method hooking (`before`, `after`, `replace`) using `XposedHelpers`.
    *   [x] Implement field reading/writing.
    *   [x] Implement object instantiation and method invocation helpers.
    *   [x] Implement dynamic DEX/class loading into target app's classloader.
    *   [x] Store active patches reliably and unhook them correctly on hot-reload or module disable.
*   [x] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [x] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [x] Design schema for simplified patch definition (class, method, hook type, basic params/return).
    *   [x] Design schema for advanced JSON/script-based patch definition.
    *   [x] Implement UI for managing a list of patches per app.
    *   [x] Develop at least 3 patch templates (SSL Unpinning, Debug Flag, Log Method).
*   [x] **Integration Points:**
    *   [x] Add checks for `PermissionOverride` if reflection fails due to visibility.
    *   [x] Expose API for other modules (like `ResourceMaster`) to request specific hooks if needed.

### B. DeepIntegrator Module [COMPLETE]
*   [x] **Core Logic (`DeepIntegratorModule.java`):**
    *   [x] Hook `PackageManagerService` methods related to component resolution.
    *   [x] Modify returned `PackageInfo`, `ActivityInfo`, `ServiceInfo`, etc., to mark components as exported.
    *   [x] Implement runtime `IntentFilter` injection/modification logic.
    *   [x] Implement mechanisms to bypass signature/permission checks.
*   [x] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [x] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [x] Implement UI to list discoverable components from target app manifest.
    *   [x] Add toggles for "Expose Component" and an editor for injecting/modifying `IntentFilter`s.
*   [x] **Integration Points:**
    *   [x] Document how `IntentMaster` should be used to route intents to components exposed by `DeepIntegrator`.
    *   [x] If hardcoded checks prevent exposure, provide guidance on using `SuperPatcher` as a fallback.

### C. PermissionOverride Module [COMPLETE]
*   [x] **Core Logic (`PermissionOverrideModule.java`):**
    *   [x] Hook `ContextImpl.checkSelfPermission` and `Activity.requestPermissions`.
    *   [x] Hook `PackageManager.checkSignatures`.
    *   [x] Implement logic to grant/revoke/fake permission status based on configuration.
    *   [x] Implement logic to bypass signature checks.
*   [x] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [x] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [x] UI for listing all standard Android permissions with Allow/Deny/Default toggles per app.
    *   [x] UI for advanced toggles (signature bypass, cross-user interaction).
    *   [x] Implement a log viewer within its settings to show permission requests and override actions.
*   [x] **Integration Points:**
    *   [x] Ensure it's loaded with high priority by `FeatureManager`.
    *   [x] Other modules should query `PermissionOverride` status or rely on its effects.

### D. ResourceMaster Module [IN PROGRESS]
*   [ ] **Core Logic (`ResourceMasterModule.java`):**
    *   [ ] Use `SuperPatcher` to hook `Resources.getValue`, `AssetManager.open`, `LayoutInflater.inflate`, etc.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to serve replacement resources/assets from module's own storage or a configured path.
    *   [ ] Handle different resource types (drawables, layouts, strings, raw, assets).
    *   [ ] Support dynamic modification of XML values (e.g., color parsing, string replacement).
*   [ ] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [ ] Design schema for app selection.
    *   [ ] Implement a basic resource browser (listing known resource types/names if possible, or allowing manual entry).
    *   [ ] UI for "Replace with file" (file picker).
    *   [ ] UI for "Modify value" for common types (strings, colors).
*   [ ] **Integration Points:**
    *   [ ] Heavy reliance on `SuperPatcher` for the underlying hook mechanisms.
    *   [ ] Consider `PermissionOverride` if writing cached/modified resources to disk is necessary.

### E. IntentMaster Module [COMPLETE]
*   [x] **Core Logic (`IntentMasterModule.java`):**
    *   [x] Hook `Activity.startActivity`, `Context.sendBroadcast`, `Context.startService`, etc.
    *   [x] Implement robust `Intent` matching logic (action, data, type, category, component, extras).
    *   [x] Implement `Intent` modification (rewrite fields, add/remove extras, change component).
    *   [x] Implement blocking and logging of `Intent`s.
*   [x] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [x] Design schema for defining `Intent` matching rules.
    *   [x] Design schema for defining actions (Modify, Redirect, Block, Log).
    *   [x] UI for creating and managing a list of rules.
    *   [x] Implement an `Intent` log viewer in its settings.
    *   [x] Add a "Test Intent" feature in the UI.
*   [x] **Integration Points:**
    *   [x] Key for leveraging components exposed by `DeepIntegrator`.
    *   [x] Can be used to trigger actions in apps based on events captured by other modules.

### F. DebugAll Module [COMPLETE]
*   [x] **Core Logic (`DebugAllModule.java`):**
    *   [x] Hook application initialization to force debug flags
    *   [x] Implement configurable debug levels
    *   [x] Support for targeting specific apps
    *   [x] Integration with system logging
*   [x] **`settings.json` & UX:**
    *   [x] Design schema for app selection and debug levels
    *   [x] UI for managing target apps
    *   [x] Debug level configuration per app
*   [x] **Integration Points:**
    *   [x] Uses `SuperPatcher` for some advanced hooking scenarios
    *   [x] Integrates with framework's logging system
